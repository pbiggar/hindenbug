# Usage

Very like trello, in the it's a board-based task ordering.

Each board is a github issue, representing something. At the top-level, that might be a team, and then at a lower lever it might be a project, a task and a list of tasks.

To be part of an issue, you have a github tag that indicated your parent. So it's a DAG, and it's recursive: you can click on a column, a card, or go to the parent, and it's turtles all the way down.

Prioritization in boards are left-to-to right, and in columns top-to-bottom. Ordering is, again, by github tag (linked list this time)

The idea is that projects are scoped only big enough to fit on a page, and may be split into multiple parts of a few tasks each.


# URL structure

/ is the dashboard
/1023 is the issue number
/new is to add new tasks


# UI

## Dashboard
Just a top-level board featuring issues tagged "top-level".

## Sidebar
Recent activity, and who is assigned to what.

## Board
Each board is for an issue, numbered I. It contains columns (C) that include all issues tagged "parent: I"

Columns contain cards which are tagged "parent: C". And so it goes.

You can click into columns or cards.

You can easily add columns or cards to issues with a search, or via a "new" button.

## New page

Contains a field for title and description. Finds issues that may have been already filed.
